# Frosh Web

`froshtiet.com` is the primary information hub for frosh events, while event bookings occur at `events.froshtiet.com` Users activate their accounts with their Thapar Institute application number and receive a login password via email. Once logged in, users can book event passes, each associated with a QR code for entry. The frosh team utilizes a specialized app for efficient attendee management, scanning QR codes to verify pass validity and confirming attendees' identities through displayed photos. A separate tech platform empowers event organizers to add or manage events and pass bookings. This comprehensive system offers a user-friendly interface, robust tools for organizers, and secure access control for a seamless eventÂ experience.
